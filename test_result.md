# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Implement comprehensive job requests & quotes marketplace functionality including: Job request form with category/title/description/postcode/photos/budget, professional listings filtered by service areas, quote system with amount/message/expiry, accept/decline flow with auto-notifications, in-app messaging with file uploads, notifications system, status management, and admin tools.

NEW FEATURE: Implement 3-step job posting wizard matching Mittanbud's flow exactly:
- Trigger: When user clicks any service category tile, navigate to the 3-step posting wizard
- Route: /post?category=<slug> with prefilled category  
- Wizard 3 steps with progress bar:
  1. Um verkið / About the Job - Title (min 10 chars), Description (min 30 chars)
  2. Samskiptaupplýsingar / Contact Info - Email, Phone with country code, Name, Address, Postcode, Contact preference (platform+phone vs platform only)
  3. Staðfest / Complete - Show summary, submit button
- UI: Centered card (~680px), beige background, progress bar with 3 dots, specific button placement
- Technical: Create/update draft JobRequest via API, persist between steps, set status 'open' on final submit, redirect to dashboard"

      message: "✅ CUSTOMER FLOW BACKEND APIS FULLY TESTED AND WORKING! Comprehensive customer dashboard flow testing completed with 24/25 tests passed (96% success rate). All priority testing areas verified: 1) Job Request APIs: customer_only filtering, pagination (page/limit), job creation/retrieval/status updates working perfectly, 2) Quote Management APIs: my_quotes filtering, quote acceptance/decline functionality working correctly, 3) Messaging APIs: job-specific messaging, conversation retrieval, file attachment upload all functional, 4) Authentication & Authorization: protected endpoints, role-based access control working properly. Customer dashboard backend APIs ready for frontend integration. Minor: One edge case with professional accessing customer-only jobs returns 500 instead of 403, but core functionality unaffected."

      message: "❌ CRITICAL FRONTEND RUNTIME ERROR BLOCKING PROFESSIONAL DASHBOARD: Professional Dashboard Phase 2 smoke test failed due to critical React Select component error. Error: 'A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string'. This runtime error prevents the Professional Dashboard from loading and causes the entire application to crash. Fixed minor syntax error in QuoteSubmissionForm.jsx (apostrophe in placeholder text). IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Main agent must fix the Select component implementation in the registration form and any other Select components to resolve this blocking issue before Professional Dashboard can be tested."

      message: "✅ SELECT COMPONENT FIXES VERIFIED - MINIMAL SMOKE TEST COMPLETED: Re-ran minimal smoke test after Select component fixes. RESULTS: 1) ✅ App loads without React errors, navigation works correctly, 2) ✅ Registration form Select dropdown functional - opens and shows Customer/Professional options without crashes, 3) ✅ All Select components now use 'all' values instead of empty strings - no 'empty string value' errors detected, 4) ✅ Professional Dashboard structure verified - 4 tabs implemented correctly, JobBidding component has proper Select components, 5) ✅ Language switching works (EN ↔ IS), 6) ❌ BLOCKING ISSUE: Mixed content security error still exists - HTTPS frontend making HTTP API calls prevents authentication testing. SELECT COMPONENT FIXES SUCCESSFUL - Professional Dashboard ready for testing once HTTPS/HTTP mixed content issue is resolved."
