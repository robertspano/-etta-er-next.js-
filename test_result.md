# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# Testing Data - Main Agent and testing sub agent both should log testing data below this section
#====================================================================================================

user_problem_statement: "Implement comprehensive job requests & quotes marketplace functionality including: Job request form with category/title/description/postcode/photos/budget, professional listings filtered by service areas, quote system with amount/message/expiry, accept/decline flow with auto-notifications, in-app messaging with file uploads, notifications system, status management, and admin tools.

NEW FEATURE: Implement 3-step job posting wizard matching Mittanbud's flow exactly:
- Trigger: When user clicks any service category tile, navigate to the 3-step posting wizard
- Route: /post?category=<slug> with prefilled category  
- Wizard 3 steps with progress bar:
  1. Um verkið / About the Job - Title (min 10 chars), Description (min 30 chars)
  2. Samskiptaupplýsingar / Contact Info - Email, Phone with country code, Name, Address, Postcode, Contact preference (platform+phone vs platform only)
  3. Staðfest / Complete - Show summary, submit button
- UI: Centered card (~680px), beige background, progress bar with 3 dots, specific button placement
- Technical: Create/update draft JobRequest via API, persist between steps, set status 'open' on final submit, redirect to dashboard

LATEST FEATURE: Implement Company Registration System based on user's screenshot:
- Route: /register-company with form matching Icelandic company registration design
- Fields: Company ID (kennitala), Electronic ID/Phone, Name, Email, Password
- Validation: Icelandic kennitala format (10 digits), phone validation (7-8 digits)
- Backend: New API endpoint POST /api/auth/register-company
- Create professional user account with company information
- Bilingual support (English/Icelandic)"

      message: "DRAFT JOB LINKING DEBUG COMPLETED - CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED! **ISSUE IDENTIFIED:** The draft job linking system had a critical bug in the contact field mapping during job updates. The update endpoint was not properly mapping contact fields from the API schema to the database schema. **ROOT CAUSE:** In /app/backend/routes/public_job_requests.py, the DraftJobRequestUpdate schema uses field names like email, phone, firstName, lastName, but the database stores them as contact_email, contact_phone, contact_first_name, contact_last_name. The update logic was not mapping these fields correctly. **FIX APPLIED:** Updated the update endpoint to properly map contact fields: email → contact_email, phone → contact_phone, firstName → contact_first_name, lastName → contact_last_name, contactPreference → contact_preference. **ADDITIONAL FIX:** Fixed import error in /app/backend/routes/auth.py line 444: changed from services.db_service import db_service to from services.database import db_service. **TESTING RESULTS:** ✅ Draft job creation working correctly, ✅ Contact email field now properly stored as contact_email, ✅ User test@verki.is exists (ID: 30c07c42-d23c-451c-a609-16166c90e5d6), ✅ Draft job linking endpoint exists and requires authentication, ❌ Authentication session issue prevents full end-to-end testing. **VERIFICATION NEEDED:** The main agent should test the complete flow: create draft job → login → call link-draft-jobs endpoint → verify jobs appear in user dashboard."

      message: "✅ LANGUAGE SWITCHING FUNCTIONALITY SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED! The user requested the ability to switch between Icelandic and English by clicking buttons in the header, just like the old React site. After investigating, I found the issue was in the Next.js layout.jsx file - the Header component was receiving language and translations from TranslationsContext but was missing the critical setLanguage function needed to actually change the language. IMPLEMENTATION: 1) Fixed layout.jsx to pass setLanguage to Header component alongside language and translations, 2) Added localStorage persistence to TranslationsContext.js to save language preferences across browser sessions using 'buildconnect_language' key, 3) Added proper client-side initialization to load saved language on app startup. TESTING RESULTS: Language switching now works perfectly - users can click English/Icelandic in the header dropdown, content immediately translates (hero title changes from 'Get the Job Done!' to 'Fáðu verkið gert!' and vice versa), and language preference persists after page refresh and browser restart.

The Next.js JobPostingWizard component requires authentication (lines 19-25 in /app/nextjs-app/components/JobPostingWizard.jsx) while the test_result.md indicates the public wizard should work without authentication. The supervisor is configured to run the Next.js app, not the React Router app. This explains why job posting redirects to login instead of working publicly. Backend APIs are working correctly - tested public job request creation successfully via curl. The issue is that the wrong frontend application is running.
