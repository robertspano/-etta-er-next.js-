<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed the verki application from its foundational stages, implementing key UI/UX features and core functionalities. This included a comprehensive rebranding, redesigns of critical pages like Job Submitted and Login to mirror , and the full development of category pages (e.g., Handcraft, Hús og garður) with full Icelandic localization (language, currency, phone, postal codes). A significant achievement was the integration of a real Gmail SMTP-based passwordless login system and a unified auto-registration and login flow, which seamlessly directs users to a -inspired customer dashboard.

The current trajectory details an immediate shift in focus. The user reported issues with the  component, requesting its restoration to a specific original design featuring an Icelandic language dropdown, distinct Skrá fyrirtæki and Setja inn verk buttons, and crucially, a single, combined button for both the menu and profile icons. Despite the AI engineer's multiple attempts to modify , restart services, and clear caches, the frontend persistently displayed the outdated header. Debugging confirmed the correct  file was being edited, but the UI refresh remains a challenge, pointing towards caching issues. The user further clarified the combined button requirement, which the AI engineer has acknowledged and is poised to address.

<product_requirements>
The verki application aims to be a construction services marketplace, emulating , with English and Icelandic localization. The development has focused on:
1.  **Branding**: A consistent verki identity, blue/cyan palette, custom logo, replacing all BuildConnect mentions.
2.  **Core Page Redesigns**: Simplified Job Submitted page; email-only passwordless Login and a separate Login with password page, mirroring .
3.  **Category Pages**: Detailed Handcraft page (responsive, 10 services, bilingual, professional placeholders); Hús og garður ported to Next.js (styled, expanded services, encouraging texts); a unified All Categories overview.
4.  **Localization**: Icelandic as default, ISK currency, +354 phone code, 3-digit postal codes.
5.  **Authentication**: Real SMTP for passwordless login; auto-registration for password login, ensuring all entry points lead to the customer dashboard.
6.  **Customer Dashboard**: -like layout with My Projects, categories, and Identity Verification.
The immediate requirement is to revert the  component to its original design, including an Icelandic language dropdown, Skrá fyrirtæki and Setja inn verk buttons, and a single, combined button for the menu and profile icon.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on thoroughly debugging and solidifying the **universal auto-registration and login system**. This involved extensive work on the backend's  and its  endpoint. Issues related to user creation, password validation (,  Pydantic models), error handling, and database interaction () were identified and resolved. The frontend component  was confirmed to correctly utilize the API endpoint. This work culminated in a successful test demonstrating that any new email and password combination correctly created an account, logged the user in, and redirected them to the customer dashboard with a personalized greeting (e.g., Hei, Róbert!). This ensures a consistent login experience from all entry points, including the Job Submitted page.

Currently, the primary focus is on a user request to revert the  component to a specific previous design. The user provided screenshots indicating the desired header should include an Icelandic language dropdown, distinct dark blue Skrá fyrirtæki and Setja inn verk buttons, and a single, combined white circular button for both the menu (3 bars) and the user profile icon, which should hover as one. The AI engineer has made modifications to  based on this feedback and has attempted restarts and cache clearing, but the UI is not reflecting these changes, consistently showing an outdated header. The AI engineer is troubleshooting this persistent caching or rendering issue.
