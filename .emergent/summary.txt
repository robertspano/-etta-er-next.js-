The AI engineer effectively continued BuildConnect development, primarily focusing on UI/UX enhancements to align the application's appearance and flow with . This involved a multi-phase effort: initially, refining header elements and the Hero section, and removing the Find Company section. Subsequently, the engineer extensively revamped the Cleaning job posting flow, transitioning it from a generic wizard to a specific 4-card, 2x2 Mittanbud-style subcategory selection. This was followed by overhauling the Post a Job button to direct users to a comprehensive 8-card job category selection page, also mirroring , complete with an integrated search bar. Finally, the All Categories overview page was entirely redesigned from a single-column list to a detailed 2-column grid featuring nested 2-column subcategory layouts, achieving pixel-perfect replication. Throughout these tasks,  was heavily utilized for visual verification and iterative refinement.

BuildConnect is a construction services marketplace, mirroring , designed to connect users with professionals. It supports both Icelandic and English languages, featuring a React frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB backend. The application previously had a redesigned homepage (Hero, How It Works, Popular Projects, Latest Reviews), a 3-step job posting wizard, and specialized flows for Automotive and Major Projects, along with a Housing Associations grid. Recent efforts focused on precise  design replication: the header's Register Company link became plain text with hover underline, the language selector shows full language names, the Hero section's professional image replaced decorative elements, and the Find Company section was removed. Subsequent tasks included transforming the Cleaning job flow into a 4-card subcategory selection, making the Post a Job button direct to an 8-card job category selection with a search bar, and redesigning the All Categories page to a 2-column grid with nested 2-column subcategories, all mimicking .

<current_work>
The immediate work focused on extensively replicating 's user flows and UI for job posting and category browsing.

1.  **Cleaning Category Flow**:
    *   **Initial Problem**: The Cleaning category, when clicked, led to a generic 3-step job posting wizard, which did not match the user's desired  experience.
    *   **Implementation**: A dedicated  component was created. Initially, it displayed 16 subcategories. Upon user feedback, it was refined to show only 4 specific categories (, , , ) in a 2x2 grid layout, along with a 3-step progress bar and search box, precisely mirroring . A corresponding  was also created.
    *   **Files Modified/Created**:  (created, then modified),  (created),  (updated routes),  (added and updated translations),  (updated routing),  (updated routing).
    *   **Status**: Fully implemented and visually confirmed to match 's cleaning flow.

2.  **Post a Job Button and Main Category Selection**:
    *   **Initial Problem**: Clicking the Post a Job button redirected users to the login page, which was not the desired  flow that takes users directly to category selection.
    *   **Implementation**: A new  component was created. This component displays 8 main job categories in a 2x4 grid layout, with Icelandic titles and English subtitles, mimicking . The Post a Job button in  was updated to navigate directly to this new page ().
    *   **Files Modified/Created**:  (created),  (added new route),  (updated button navigation).
    *   **Status**: Fully implemented and confirmed to redirect correctly and display the 8-category grid.

3.  **Search Bar on Job Category Selection Page**:
    *   **Initial Problem**: The newly implemented  page was missing a search bar, a prominent feature on 's category selection.
    *   **Implementation**: A search bar with a What do you need help with? placeholder and a blue arrow button was integrated into , matching 's design and functionality (including bilingual support for the placeholder text).
    *   **Files Modified**:  (modified).
    *   **Status**: Fully implemented, visually confirmed for both English and Icelandic languages.

4.  **All Categories Overview Page Redesign**:
    *   **Initial Problem**: The existing All Categories page was a single-column list, not matching 's structured 2-column grid with nested 2-column subcategories.
    *   **Implementation**: The  component was completely restructured to render main categories in a 2-column grid, with each category box further containing its subcategories organized into two vertical columns. This involved extensive content and styling changes to achieve pixel-perfect replication.
    *   **Files Modified**:  (extensively modified).
    *   **Status**: Fully implemented, confirmed to match 's complex 2-column grid and internal 2-column subcategory layout.

Throughout these tasks, the AI engineer used  extensively to verify visual changes and ensure compliance with the user's detailed design requests, demonstrating an iterative refinement process until pixel-perfect results were achieved.
