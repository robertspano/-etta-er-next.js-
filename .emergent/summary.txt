The previous AI engineer successfully brought the BuildConnect application from MVP to a feature-rich product. This included completing the Customer Dashboard and implementing the Professional Dashboard, addressing critical frontend issues like  values. A major effort involved a comprehensive homepage redesign to match the Mittanbud layout, refining existing components and adding new ones like .

The most recent work focused intensely on the header and right-side drawer. Initially, the header was restructured with specific elements and styling. This evolved into integrating a sliding side drawer. A temporary deviation saw the avatar opening a separate login page, which was immediately reverted by the user to ensure the *entire* header pill (hamburger and avatar combined) triggered *only* the single right-side drawer. The final phase involved fine-tuning the drawer's animation to precisely match a user-provided video, achieving a 300ms slide-in with a custom cubic-bezier easing. The current state is a fully functional, highly polished, and Mittanbud-accurate header and drawer system with complete bilingual support.

The BuildConnect application is a construction services marketplace inspired by , supporting both Icelandic and English. It features a React frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. Key functionalities include:
1.  **User Authentication:** A robust system with , HTTP-only cookies, Google OAuth, email verification, and role-based access for customers, professionals, and admins.
2.  **Professional Dashboard:** A Mittanbud style interface for professionals to manage job requests, bids, quotes, in-app messaging, profiles, ratings, and reviews, with bilingual UI. Invoicing and payouts are deferred.
3.  **Core Marketplace Flow:** Users submit job requests (category, title, description, postcode, photos, budget), professionals view listings and submit quotes. Jobs progress through statuses:  →  →  →  →  | . Admin tools and notifications are also in scope, but payments are deferred.
4.  **Homepage Redesign (Mittanbud Style):** A complete visual overhaul of the homepage to match provided  screenshots, including a specific Hero section layout (left text/search, right image), followed by Services, How It Works, Trust Stats, Testimonials, a Call to Action banner, and Footer. Styling emphasizes max-width, generous padding, large typography, specific component sizing, subtle shadows, and alternating section backgrounds.

-   ****:
    -   Importance: Defines the main navigation bar, including branding, language switcher, action buttons, and user profile.
    -   Changes: Extensively modified to match Mittanbud's layout. Initial changes removed old navigation links, reordered right-side elements (language switcher, Register Company, Post Project, profile avatar). Later, a hamburger menu was added alongside the avatar. Most recently, both hamburger and avatar were encapsulated into a *single, interactive pill-shaped button* that triggers a full-height right-side drawer. Drawer states, focus management, and animation properties (, ) were implemented here.
-   ****:
    -   Importance: Centralizes all UI text for bilingual support (Icelandic/English).
    -   Changes: Extended to include new translation keys for Register Company (), Post Project (), and various drawer category items (, , , , , , , ) for both English and Icelandic.
-   ****:
    -   Importance: Main React application file, responsible for setting up global contexts, routing, and arranging main page sections.
    -   Changes: Updated to include new routes for the professional dashboard and to reorder homepage sections (, , , , , , ) to match the Mittanbud visual flow.
-   ****:
    -   Importance: The prominent top section of the landing page, designed to capture user attention and guide them.
    -   Changes: Significantly refactored for the Mittanbud layout, creating a 60-65% left column for text/search and a 35-40% right column for an image on desktop, with vertical stacking on mobile. Categories grid was adjusted for 4 columns on desktop and 2 on mobile.

<current_work>
The BuildConnect application is a functional MVP with a complete authentication system and foundational marketplace APIs. Phase 1 (Customer Dashboard) and Phase 2 (Professional Dashboard) implementations are complete. The Professional Dashboard includes  and , a tabbed interface, and essential translations. A  component issue was resolved across several frontend components, standardizing empty string values to all for filter logic.

The most recent and significant work involved a comprehensive **homepage redesign** to match the Mittanbud layout. This included:
-   **Hero Section**:  was refactored for a 60-65% left column (title, search, categories) and a 35-40% right image on desktop, with vertical stacking on mobile.
-   **Section Reordering**:  was updated to arrange homepage sections in the Mittanbud order: , , , , , , .
-   **Component Restyling**: , , , and  were modified for consistent visual rhythm.
-   **New Component**:  was created.

The current focus concluded with extensive work on the **Header** and its integrated **right-side drawer**:
-   The header was initially redesigned to remove old navigation links and reorder action elements: Language switcher, Register Company, Post Project, and Profile avatar.
-   The hamburger menu icon was introduced.
-   Crucially, the **hamburger and profile avatar** were combined into a **single, interactive, rounded pill-shaped button**. This pill now serves as the *sole trigger* for the right-side drawer.
-   The drawer itself is a **full-height panel** sliding in from the right with a width of ~384px. It has a clean header (only an 'X' close button, no Menu title).
-   The drawer content is precisely ordered: A Login row (with an avatar icon on the left and a chevron on the right), Post Project (primary link style), Register Company (secondary link style), a divider, a Categories heading, and a list of category items with chevrons.
-   All header and drawer texts are driven by existing i18n keys for full bilingual support.
-   **Animation and UX**: The drawer slides in smoothly with a 300ms duration and  easing, mimicking the Mittanbud video. It includes a subtle backdrop fade, focus trapping, body scroll lock, and can be closed via ESC, 'X' button, or backdrop click.
-   **Accessibility**: The pill uses proper button semantics, keyboard support (Enter/Space), and .

The application's header and drawer system now perfectly match the Mittanbud design in terms of layout, visual rhythm, content, behavior, and animation, and fully supports bilingual functionality.
