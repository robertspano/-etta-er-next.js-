The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the BuildConnect application from an MVP to a feature-rich product. This included completing customer and professional dashboards, refining the header, and integrating an animated right-side drawer. The immediate prior focus was on implementing a 3-step public job posting wizard, which involved making frontend routes public and creating new public backend API endpoints. Debugging this wizard revealed critical issues with  and environment variable access, which were addressed, but a Failed to save progress error persisted, awaiting user re-test. Crucially, the user then *shifted focus* to a homepage redesign, explicitly requesting to keep the Hero section as-is, while revamping How it works and introducing a Popular Projects section. The AI engineer successfully completed this new homepage task, updating translations, modifying , creating , and adjusting  component ordering. Visual and functional tests confirmed the precise layout, responsiveness, and navigation from the new sections. The language switch functionality was noted as a minor issue but was not the primary focus of this task.

<product_requirements>
The BuildConnect application is a construction services marketplace, inspired by , supporting Icelandic and English. It features a React frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB backend with robust authentication (roles, Google OAuth, email verification). Core functionalities include a Mittanbud style Professional Dashboard, and a marketplace flow for job requests, bidding, and status tracking. The application underwent a comprehensive homepage redesign mirroring , including distinct Hero, Services, How It Works, Trust Stats, Testimonials, Call to Action, and Footer sections. Recent development integrated a 3-step job posting wizard allowing public users to post requests without login, matching 's flow, layout, validation, and step progression. This wizard saves draft progress using local storage and newly created public backend API endpoints. The latest work successfully redesigned the homepage to feature an updated How it works section and a new Popular Projects section, while keeping the Hero component unchanged.

<current_work>
The BuildConnect application currently features a complete authentication system, foundational marketplace APIs, and implemented Customer/Professional Dashboards. The AI engineer's immediate prior focus was on developing a **3-step public job posting wizard**, intended to mirror the Mittanbud user experience and allow unauthenticated users to submit job requests. This involved making frontend routes public (e.g., ) and creating new public API endpoints in the backend (, , ). Progress for guest users is persisted using  for . During this implementation, a persistent Failed to save progress error emerged, despite backend logs showing 200 OK responses and the  issue being believed resolved locally. This issue was pending user re-test with cache cleared and new debugging info.

Subsequently, the user introduced a new, high-priority task: a **comprehensive homepage redesign**. The Hero section was explicitly to remain untouched. The How it works section () was refactored to a centered 3-step layout with numbered badges, icons, titles, short descriptions, and a prominent Post Project / Legg ut jobb call-to-action button. A new Popular Projects section () was created, designed to display existing category tiles in a responsive grid (4 columns on desktop, 3 on tablet, 2 on mobile), matching the styling of the Hero section's tiles. These new sections were integrated into , adjusting the component order. The AI engineer successfully implemented and verified these homepage changes through multiple screenshots and functional tests (including navigation from the new Popular Projects section to the job posting wizard). A minor issue with language switching was observed but deferred as out of the scope of this specific task.
