The previous AI engineer successfully continued the development of the BuildConnect application, focusing on direct user feedback for UI/UX enhancements. Initially, the engineer had refined several homepage sections (Housing Associations Grid, Find Company Section, Popular Projects, Reviews Section, Pro Signup Section) and performed comprehensive Norwegian-to-Icelandic/English translations. The recent work, as detailed in the trajectory, centered on immediate user requests related to the application's header and Hero section. This involved modifying the Register Company link to be plain text with a hover underline, overhauling the language selector to display full language names with a single dropdown arrow, and integrating a new professional image into the Hero section while meticulously removing all surrounding decorative elements (white box, stars, text, shadows). Finally, the Find Company Section was completely removed as per user instruction. The engineer consistently used  to verify changes, ensuring pixel-perfect alignment with user's visual expectations.

<product_requirements>
BuildConnect is a construction services marketplace that mirrors , designed to connect users with construction professionals, supporting both Icelandic and English languages. The application, built with React frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB backend, aims for feature expansion and refinement. Existing features include a redesigned homepage with Hero, How It Works, Popular Projects, Find the right company, and Latest Reviews sections, alongside a 3-step job posting wizard. Specialized flows for Automotive (with vehicle lookup) and Major Projects (routing to ) are also implemented. The UI is responsive and localized via . Recent work included overhauling the Moving category flow and implementing a Housing Associations grid. The primary focus of the most recent interaction was precise replication of  design elements, specifically by refining header components (modifying Register Company display and language selector) and customizing the Hero section's image presentation, and removing the Find Company section from the homepage.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS (for styling and responsiveness), Axios, React Context API, React Router DOM,  (multilingual support).
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, MongoDB, Motor, Beanie ODM.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured into  and  services within the  directory.



-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Central for routing and global language state. It defines the main application structure and imports/renders various components based on routes.
    -   **Changes Made**: The  component import and its rendering within the  component were completely removed to eliminate the section from the frontend.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores all multilingual UI texts, enabling  support throughout the application.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file was extensively updated in previous phases for various sections and languages. While read during the recent interaction to find Register Company translations, no new modifications were explicitly mentioned in the provided trajectory.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Renders the main navigation header, including company registration and language selection.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   The Register Company button was transformed from a bordered button into plain text with a hover underline effect.
        -   The language selector was changed from a compact EN/IS pill-style to display full language names (English, Icelandic) with a single dropdown arrow. This involved removing a redundant  icon.
        -   These style changes were applied to both desktop and mobile versions of the header.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main hero section of the homepage, typically featuring a call to action and visual elements.
    -   **Changes Made**: The Trusted Professionals block (lines 216-238) was replaced with a new professional image. All surrounding elements, including the white box/polaroid card, yellow/green circles, 5-star rating, 15,000+ Happy Customers text, and any associated shadow/border effects, were removed to leave only the clean image.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: A component designed for users to find companies based on project types and postcodes.
    -   **Changes Made**: This entire component was logically removed from the  rendering to eliminate its presence on the homepage, as explicitly requested by the user.

<current_work>
The immediate work focused on specific UI/UX refinements within the BuildConnect application's frontend, driven by explicit user requests.

1.  **Header Modifications**:
    *   **Register Company Link**: The user requested to remove the outer line/border around the Register Company text and add an underline effect on hover. The AI engineer located  and modified the styling to transform the bordered button into plain text, incorporating a  class.
    *   **Language Selector**: The user desired a change from the existing pill-style EN/IS language selector to one showing full language names (English, Icelandic) with a single dropdown arrow, matching a provided screenshot. The engineer updated  to achieve this, addressing an issue where a redundant  icon was causing a double arrow appearance by removing it. These changes were applied consistently to both desktop and mobile views to ensure responsive design.

2.  **Hero Section Image Refinement**:
    *   **Image Replacement and Simplification**: The user initially requested to replace the Trusted Professionals block in the Hero section with a new image. After the image was placed, the user explicitly asked to remove all surrounding elements – the white box, yellow/green circles, 5-star rating, 15,000+ Happy Customers text, and any shadows or borders – leaving only the clean image. The AI engineer iteratively modified , removing multiple  wrappers, Tailwind CSS classes related to backgrounds, shadows, borders, and rounded corners, and the hardcoded content that created the decorative elements. The goal was to make the image blend seamlessly with the background.

3.  **Removal of Find Company Section**:
    *   **Section Elimination**: The user explicitly requested to remove the section titled Finndu rétta fyrirtækið fyrir verkefnið þitt!. The AI engineer identified that this corresponded to the  component. To remove it, the component's rendering call and its corresponding import statement were deleted from .

Throughout these tasks, the AI engineer consistently used the  to verify visual changes and ensure compliance with the user's detailed design requests, demonstrating an iterative refinement process until pixel-perfect results were achieved.
