The AI engineer's work primarily focused on transforming the BuildConnect application into a pixel-perfect replica of mittanbud.no in terms of UI, UX, and page structure. Initially, foundational UI elements like the header and hero section were refined, and the Find Company section removed. The Cleaning job posting flow was rebuilt into a specific 4-card selection, and the Post a Job button was re-routed to an 8-card category selection page with an integrated search. The All Categories overview was completely redesigned to a 2-column grid. Subsequently, the focus shifted to replicating all missing  pages, including a comprehensive company search system, main category landing pages (Handcraft, House & Garden, Interior Renovation, Build New, Services), professional pages (Electrician, Plumber, Painter, Carpenter, Mason), and support pages (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy). A significant mid-task pivot involved converting all existing Norwegian text and sample data to English and Icelandic, ensuring full bilingual support. Throughout,  was extensively used for visual validation, demonstrating an iterative, detail-oriented approach to achieving exact replication.
