The trajectory details the iterative development and debugging of the verki application, transitioning from UI/UX refinements to complex feature integrations. Initial efforts focused on recreating the  customer dashboard, including a custom header, notification panel, and project listing. A major phase involved debugging Firebase phone authentication, which required fixing missing configuration, invalid API keys, and phone number formatting, eventually hitting a billing enablement issue. The focus then shifted to implementing the Mittanbud-style job posting flow, allowing anonymous posting followed by authentication to link jobs to a user's dashboard. This involved significant backend changes for draft job linking and frontend adjustments for authentication redirects and dynamic content display. The work concludes with a persistent issue where the customer dashboard fails to display linked projects, despite backend verification of job linking, pointing to a frontend data fetching or authentication cookie problem.

The verki application is a construction services marketplace, designed to mimic , with full Icelandic and English localization.
1.  **Branding & UI**: Consistent verki identity, blue/cyan palette, custom logo, simplified Job Submitted and Login pages. Removed Choose category below... from Hero section. Custom smiley emoticon for profile icon.
2.  **Category Pages**: Responsive Handcraft, Hús og garður, and All Categories pages with Icelandic content.
3.  **Localization**: Default Icelandic ('is'), ISK currency, +354 phone code, 3-digit postal codes.
4.  **Authentication**: Firebase Phone Auth (triggered by Staðfesta með rafrænum skilríkjum), real SMTP for passwordless login, auto-registration, and redirection to customer dashboard.
5.  **Customer Dashboard**: -like layout featuring My Projects, Identity Verification, and a category overview. Requires a specific header (Nýtt verk, notification bell with dropdown, profile icon), a right-side slide-in menu, and a footer. My Projects page should display active/completed jobs with status.
6.  **Job Posting Flow**: Users can post jobs anonymously via a multi-step wizard. After posting, a View Post button on the success page prompts login (if not authenticated) to link the job to their account and view it on their dashboard.
7.  **Sidebar Content**: Remove the UPPLÝSINGAR section (including Þjónustuskilmálar and Persónuverndarstefna) from the homepage's main sidebar.

**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Created for Firebase phone auth, integrated user config, added phone formatting and validation.
-   : **New file** for Firebase SDK initialization with user's project credentials.
-   : Updated to fetch and display user projects, integrated notification bell with a dropdown, and sidebar logic.
-   : Refactored to replicate Mittanbud's project list, and now shares the identical header and sidebar structure with the main dashboard.
-   : **New file** to act as a root  route, redirecting appropriately.
-   : **New file** created for displaying individual job details.
-   : Modified to remove the UPPLÝSINGAR (Information) section from the homepage's main sidebar.
-   : Adjusted to allow public job posting, collecting  and  for later linkage, aligning with the Mittanbud UX flow.
-   : Enhanced with a View Post button that intelligently redirects to the job detail page, prompting login if necessary and passing a .
-   : Updated to process  parameters for post-login redirection and to call the new backend  endpoint to associate anonymously posted jobs.
-   : Modified to include  and  fields in the  schema and save this contact information when a draft job is created.
-   : A new  endpoint was introduced. It's responsible for finding draft jobs matching a user's email and updating their  and  upon successful login.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively engaged in troubleshooting why user-posted projects were not appearing in the customer dashboard (). Despite a critical fix being applied by the backend testing agent (resolving a  schema mismatch in ) and backend confirmation that draft jobs were successfully linked to a test user's account (), the dashboard persistently displayed an Engin virk verkefni (empty projects) state. Frontend testing showed 3 issues in console logs (), and further investigation revealed that while user data was stored in  post-login, authentication cookies were not being properly set or utilized by frontend API calls (). The AI had confirmed  was used in  and API calls but suspected the issue lay in the dashboard's specific API call or the way cookies were handled within the Next.js environment, preventing proper project data retrieval. The Mittanbud-style flow (anonymous job posting, then login to link via View Post) has been implemented, but its effectiveness is hindered by the dashboard's failure to display the linked projects.
