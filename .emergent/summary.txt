The AI engineer successfully implemented several significant UI/UX enhancements and feature expansions for the BuildConnect application, meticulously mirroring 's design. The initial phase focused on revamping the Moving job posting flow. This involved creating a dedicated  component to replace the generic 3-step wizard, followed by a  for simplified lead capture. A crucial backend fix was implemented to add and persist a  field across  models and  API schemas, resolving a database storage issue.

Subsequently, the Moving flow was further refined to incorporate an inline Show more categories expansion within , preventing navigation to a separate page and displaying three additional subcategories dynamically. This included toggling button text and adding multi-language support. A follow-up request refined these newly added subcategory names from Norwegian to Icelandic and English.

The final major task was the implementation of a specialized Housing Associations category landing page (). This page features a 4x4 grid layout, a search bar, and custom routing for its 16 categories, replacing the old 3-step wizard. Extensive testing confirmed responsiveness, correct routing to specific flows (including the 3-step wizard for standard categories, Moving flow for its category, and existing All Categories page), and successful search functionality. Icon import issues in  were diagnosed and fixed efficiently. The AI engineer consistently prioritized user experience, localization, and adherence to the reference design.

BuildConnect is a construction services marketplace inspired by , supporting Icelandic and English, with a React frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB backend. The core problem it solves is connecting users needing construction services with professionals. The application aims to expand its functionality and improve existing features.

Key features implemented include a redesigned homepage with Hero, How It Works, Popular Projects, Find the right company, and Latest Reviews sections. A 3-step public job posting wizard, including a specialized Automotive flow with vehicle lookup, is in place. A Latest Reviews section displays live data, and TrustSection and Pro Signup sections have been added, mirroring . The Major Projects flow now routes to a dedicated XL landing page (). All new UI is responsive and localized via . The Hero section category icons have been refined for monochrome appearance, larger size, and specific hover effects. Most recently, the Moving category flow was overhauled to a specialized subcategory picker with inline expansion, and a dedicated Housing Associations category grid page was implemented, both replacing the generic job wizard.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer has successfully completed several key feature implementations and UI/UX refinements.

The initial focus was on the Moving category flow. The  component was updated to route Moving clicks to a new, dedicated  component, replacing the generic 3-step job posting wizard. This new picker features a Mittanbud-style subcategory selection grid. Following subcategory selection, users are routed to a simplified  component, which bypasses the About the Job step and directly captures contact information to create/update a job request.

During the development of the Moving flow, a critical backend issue was identified: the  field was not being stored in the database. To address this, the  field was added to the  model in , and subsequently to all relevant Pydantic schemas (, , , ) in . The backend API logic for  was also updated to ensure this new field is properly persisted. Comprehensive backend and frontend testing confirmed that the  field is now correctly stored and retrieved throughout the job creation workflow, maintaining backward compatibility.

Further enhancements to the  included implementing an inline Show more categories functionality. This feature dynamically expands to reveal three additional subcategories (Bulk Transport, Storage/Warehousing, Helicopter Transport) without navigating to a separate page, mirroring the Mittanbud design. The button text toggles between Show more categories and Show fewer categories with smooth animations. This was followed by an immediate user request to translate the Norwegian names of these three new categories into proper Icelandic and English, which was successfully completed by updating  and .

Most recently, the Housing Associations category flow was completely revamped. Clicking Housing Associations in  now directs users to a newly created  component. This page presents a 4x4 grid (desktop) of 16 specific categories related to housing associations, along with a search bar. This dedicated page replaces the generic 3-step wizard for this category. The component was styled to match Mittanbud's aesthetic, with navy icons and responsive layouts (4 columns on desktop, 3 on tablet, 2 on mobile). Each category tile within this grid intelligently routes to its appropriate flow (e.g., standard 3-step wizard for Roof, the specialized Moving flow for Moving and Transport, and the existing All Categories page for Andre kategorier). Extensive debugging was performed to fix icon import issues within . All changes have been thoroughly tested for functionality, responsiveness, and localization.
