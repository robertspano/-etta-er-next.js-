The previous AI engineer brought the BuildConnect application from an MVP to a feature-rich product. This included completing customer and professional dashboards, fixing frontend issues, and redesigning the homepage to match Mittanbud. A significant effort was spent on refining the header and implementing a precise, animated right-side drawer.

The most recent and current work focused on a 3-step job posting wizard. Initially, it was developed with authentication, but the user explicitly requested it to be publicly accessible without login. The AI engineer implemented this by making frontend routes public, updating the  component, creating new public backend API endpoints, and adjusting authentication dependencies. A persistent Failed to save progress error emerged during testing. Debugging revealed initial issues with frontend environment variable access ( vs ) and critically, the  pointing to an incorrect external URL instead of the local backend. Although the AI engineer believes this core API connectivity issue is resolved and the wizard progresses locally, the user continues to report the error, suggesting a caching or specific browser state problem. The AI engineer has added further debugging and is awaiting user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The BuildConnect application is a construction services marketplace inspired by , designed for both Icelandic and English users. It uses a React frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. Its core functionalities include robust user authentication (roles, Google OAuth, email verification), a Mittanbud style Professional Dashboard for managing jobs and profiles, and a core marketplace flow for job requests, bidding, and status tracking (payments deferred). The application features a comprehensive homepage redesign matching  visuals, including a distinct Hero section, Services, How It Works, Trust Stats, Testimonials, a Call to Action, and Footer. The current work extended this by implementing a 3-step job posting wizard that allows public users to post job requests without logging in, mirroring the  user experience for layout, validation, and step progression.

<current_work>
The BuildConnect application has a complete authentication system and foundational marketplace APIs. The Customer and Professional Dashboards are implemented. The most recent work focused on a comprehensive homepage redesign and a refined header with an integrated, animated right-side drawer.

Currently, the primary task revolved around implementing a **3-step public job posting wizard**, matching the Mittanbud flow:
-   **Trigger**: Clicking any service category tile on the homepage.
-   **Routing**: Navigates to , prefilling the chosen category. This route's  was removed to allow public access.
-   **Wizard Steps**:
    1.  **About the Job**: Collects  (min 10 chars) and  (min 30 chars).
    2.  **Contact Info**: Collects ,  (with country code select), , , , , and .
    3.  **Complete**: Shows a summary and a Finish/Submit button.
-   **Backend Integration**: New public API endpoints (, , ) were created and integrated. These endpoints optionally use an authenticated user but allow unauthenticated access via a  cookie. Draft job requests are saved and updated between steps using  for .
-   **UI/UX**: Matches Mittanbud with a centered card layout, beige background, a 3-dot progress bar, specific button placement (Back, Next/Finish), and full i18n support. A  and improved error messages have been added.

**Current Problem**: Although internal testing (both backend and frontend) shows the wizard successfully progresses through steps and API calls succeed (with ), the user is still intermittently reporting a Failed to save progress error and has provided a screenshot of it. The AI engineer has verified backend logs showing 200 OK responses and confirmed that the frontend is now correctly targeting the local backend URL. The working hypothesis is a client-side caching issue or a race condition.

The next step is to await the user's re-test results with cache cleared and new debugging information from the browser console.
