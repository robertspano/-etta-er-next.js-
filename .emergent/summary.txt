The AI engineer successfully progressed BuildConnect from MVP, replicating 's design and functionality. Initial work focused on a robust company registration system, extensive category page population with bilingual support, and comprehensive enhancements to five professional service pages (Electrician, Plumber, Painter, Carpenter, Mason), matching the reference site's detail. A recent explicit request to remove the Find company navigation section was also completed. The project then transitioned to a critical migration from React to Next.js (App Router), a user-mandated change. The AI engineer initiated the migration by setting up the Next.js project structure, configuring core files, and systematically porting components. The process is currently ongoing, having faced and attempted to resolve several build issues related to module imports and Next.js setup, with the backend confirmed functional.

<product_requirements>
The BuildConnect application aims to be a construction services marketplace, replicating 's design and features, with full English and Icelandic localization. The initial MVP included a redesigned homepage and a 3-step job posting wizard. Key requirements evolved to include comprehensive UI/UX replication (Header, Hero section, navigation removal), redesigning job posting flows, and revamping the All Categories overview. A critical requirement was a new company registration page, mirroring a provided screenshot with fields for Company ID, Electronic ID/Phone, Name, Email, and Password. All main category pages (Handcraft, House & Garden, Interior Renovation, Build New, Services) required extensive subcategory expansion, reflecting 's listings with bilingual support. The most recent major directive is to fully migrate the entire codebase from React to Next.js (App Router) while preserving design and functionality, with all future development to occur in Next.js.

-   **Frontend**: React.js (legacy), Next.js (App Router - target), Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM, React Context API, Axios, i18n.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, MongoDB (Motor, Beanie ODM), .
-   **Tools/Practices**:  for UI/UX validation,  for backend validation.

<code_architecture>
The application currently consists of two main services:  (FastAPI) and  (React), located in the  directory. A new  directory has been created for the ongoing migration.



-   ****: Central routing and language state management. Changes included updating routes for company registration and adding routes for new category/professional pages.
-   ****: Stores all multilingual UI text. Extensively updated for new pages, expanded subcategories, job categories, and full bilingual (Norwegian/English/Icelandic) content.
-   ****: Renders main navigation and language selector. Updated Register Company link, language selector, and most recently, removed the Find company navigation link.
-   ****: New component for company registration form (Company ID, Electronic ID/Phone, Name, Email, Password). Handles submission and API interaction.
-   ****: Handles authentication. A new  public endpoint was added for professional user account creation.
-   ****: Manages frontend API calls. Added  function and switched to  for unauthenticated registration to resolve session expired errors.
-   ****: Manages authentication state. A  function was added to prevent stale error messages.
-   ****: User login. Calls  on mount, displays success messages, and pre-fills email after successful company registration.
-   **Category Pages (e.g., ,  etc.)**: Significantly expanded to include numerous new services/subcategories (e.g., from 6 to 19 in Handcraft), ensuring comprehensive bilingual support mirroring .
-   **Professional Pages (e.g., ,  etc.)**: Extensively enhanced with detailed service lists, pricing, How to choose..., Recent projects, Certifications, and updated statistics, replicating .
-   ****: New directory for Next.js project. Core files like , ,  have been set up.  and  are created as entry points. Various components, contexts, data, and service files are being migrated into this new structure, mirroring the original React application's organization.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed two major feature sets: a comprehensive company registration system and extensive content expansion on all main category and professional service pages, including bilingual support and removal of the Find company navigation link.

The *current* and most recent task is the full migration of the existing React codebase to Next.js (App Router). This involves creating a new  directory and systematically porting components and configurations.
The AI engineer has:
1.  Initialized a Next.js project structure within .
2.  Created core Next.js configuration files: , , , and .
3.  Set up the  directory structure with , , and .
4.  Migrated key  (),  (), and  ().
5.  Migrated core UI components and utility files, including:
    *   
    *   , , , , , 
    *   
    *   Homepage sections: , , , , , 
    *   Authentication and registration components: , , with corresponding routes like .
6.  Attempted to install dependencies and run the Next.js build (yarn run v1.22.22

However, the Next.js migration is *not yet complete or fully functional*. The AI engineer has encountered and is actively troubleshooting several build issues, including:
*    errors, indicating dependency/path issues.
*    and similar path alias issues.
*    errors, suggesting deeper Next.js configuration problems or incorrect component usage in the App Router context.

The backend has been confirmed as functional and ready via . The current focus remains on resolving the Next.js frontend build issues.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue resolving the Next.js build errors, specifically addressing module import issues and ensuring all components are correctly migrated and rendered within the Next.js App Router environment to achieve a successful build and run.
