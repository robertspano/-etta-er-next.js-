The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the BuildConnect application from an MVP to a feature-rich product. Initially, the focus was on establishing robust authentication using FastAPI-Users and React's AuthContext. Following this, the project advanced into core marketplace functionalities. Phase 1, the Customer Dashboard, was completed. The subsequent major effort was Phase 2: Professional Dashboard implementation. This involved creating  and , extensively updating  for tabs and data integration, and adding necessary translations and routing. A critical  component issue was identified and resolved by standardizing empty string values to all across multiple frontend components, ensuring dashboard functionality. Backend APIs for professional workflows were successfully tested.

After completing the Professional Dashboard, the focus shifted to a significant homepage redesign to match the Mittanbud layout. This involved several iterative rearrangements of existing components (, , , , ) and the creation of  (despite instructions against new components). The Hero section underwent multiple refinements to achieve precise positioning of the title, search input, categories, and image for both desktop and mobile, with the final layout matching the user's specific requirements regarding column structure and element placement.

The BuildConnect application is conceived as a construction services marketplace, aiming for a design similar to  with bilingual support (Icelandic/English). The MVP established a React frontend with core static sections and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend.

Key features developed or planned include:
1.  **User Authentication:** Robust session-based system with , HTTP-only cookies, Google OAuth, email verification, magic links, standard login/register/forgot password, protected routes, and role-based access (customer, professional, admin).
2.  **Professional Dashboard:** A Mittanbud style interface for professionals to manage job requests, bids, quotes, in-app messaging (with file uploads), calendar, service areas, contractor profiles, ratings/reviews, and a bilingual UI. Invoicing and payouts are deferred.
3.  **Core Marketplace Flow:** Users can submit job requests (category, title, description, postcode, photos, budget), professionals can view listings and submit quotes, and jobs progress through defined statuses (open → quoted → accepted → in_progress → completed | cancelled). Admin tools and notifications are also part of the scope. Payments are deferred.
4.  **Homepage Redesign (Mittanbud Style):** The latest requirement focuses on a complete visual overhaul of the homepage, matching the layout, proportions, spacing, and visual rhythm of provided screenshots. This includes a specific Hero section arrangement (left text block with title, subtitle, search, and categories; right image), followed by sections for Services, How It Works, Trust Stats, Testimonials, a Call to Action banner, and Footer. Styling guidelines emphasize a max width of ~1200px, generous vertical padding, large H1, specific input/border-radius sizing, subtle shadows, and alternating section backgrounds, while maintaining existing branding and bilingual support.

<current_work>
The BuildConnect application is a functional MVP with a complete authentication system and foundational marketplace APIs. Phase 1, focusing on the Customer Dashboard, has been successfully implemented and tested.

The previous work concluded Phase 2: Professional Dashboard Implementation. This included:
-   Creation of  and .
-   Updating  for a tabbed interface (Open Jobs, My Quotes, Messages, Profile) and integrating new components, preparing for real data.
-   Adding necessary English and Icelandic translations for new professional features.
-   Updating  with professional-specific routes (, ).
-   Successful verification of backend APIs for the professional workflow (92.6% success rate).
A critical  component issue was identified during frontend smoke testing (where empty string  attributes caused failures). This was fixed by replacing empty strings with all and updating filter logic across , , , , and . Post-fix, the frontend smoke test passed, confirming basic functionality.

Following this, the most recent work involved a comprehensive **homepage redesign** to precisely match the Mittanbud layout. This task included:
-   **Hero Section Rearrangement**: The  component was significantly refactored to place the title, subtitle, search input, and service categories in a 60-65% left column, with the polaroid image in a 35-40% right column on desktop. Mobile layouts ensure vertical stacking (Title → Subtitle → Input → Categories → Image). The categories grid now displays in 4 columns on desktop and 2 columns on mobile.
-   **Section Reordering**: The main  file was updated to arrange homepage sections in the exact Mittanbud order:  (with integrated categories), , ,  (as trust section), , , and .
-   **Component Restyling**: , , , and  were modified to match Mittanbud's card proportions, shadows, and overall visual rhythm.
-   **New Component Creation**: A  component was created to serve as the CTA banner, and its translations were added to .
-   **Styling Consistency**: Global styles were adjusted for max width (~1200px), section vertical padding (64-96px), border-radius (12-16px), subtle shadows, and alternating beige/white section backgrounds.

The homepage now accurately reflects the requested Mittanbud layout, visual rhythm, and responsiveness across desktop and mobile, while maintaining BuildConnect branding and bilingual support.
