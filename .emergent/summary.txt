The AI engineer's work has meticulously followed the  replication strategy, focusing on both UI/UX and core functional enhancements. Key accomplishments include the robust implementation of a company registration system, addressing intricate API client and navigation issues. A major effort was dedicated to extensively populating main category pages with detailed subcategories, ensuring bilingual support and pixel-perfect design matching. Most recently, the engineer successfully enhanced all five professional service pages (Electrician, Plumber, Painter, Carpenter, Mason) by adding comprehensive content, detailed service lists, pricing, and specific sections like certifications and how-to guides, aligning them with the reference site. The very last explicit user request was addressed by removing the Find company section from the website's navigation drawer, which was also completed. The trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach, including backend testing and frontend screenshot validation, ensuring stability and visual accuracy.

The BuildConnect application aims to establish a construction services marketplace, mirroring 's design and features, with full English and Icelandic localization. The initial MVP involved a redesigned homepage and a 3-step job posting wizard. Explicit user requirements have driven recent development, including comprehensive UI/UX replication (e.g., Header, Hero section, removing Find Company), redesigning job posting flows (e.g., Cleaning to 4-card subcategory, Post a Job to 8-card main category), and revamping the All Categories overview. A critical requirement was to implement a new company registration page, accurately matching a provided screenshot with fields for Company ID, Electronic ID/Phone, Name, Email, and Password. Furthermore, all main category pages (Handcraft, House & Garden, Interior Renovation, Build New, Services) needed extensive expansion of subcategories to comprehensively reflect 's listings, ensuring complete bilingual support.
