The AI engineer successfully progressed the BuildConnect application through several significant feature implementations and UI/UX enhancements. Key phases included the initial resolution of a frontend API connectivity bug (). This was followed by the full implementation of the Automotive job posting flow, including new frontend components () and backend extensions (, ). A comprehensive reviews system was then integrated, involving new backend models, API routes, and frontend display (). Extensive homepage redesigns were undertaken, revamping the Hero, How It Works, and Popular Projects sections for a modern aesthetic. Subsequent iterations focused on adding a TrustSection and a Pro Signup section, mirroring 's design. The most recent work involved a significant overhaul of the Major Projects flow to a dedicated XL landing page and, finally, iterative refinements of the Hero section category icons, ensuring they were monochrome, clear, appropriately sized, and had the exact hover effects and grid layout as the reference.

<current_work>
The BuildConnect application's homepage has undergone significant iterative refinement. Most recently, the focus was entirely on perfecting the visual appearance and user experience of the **Hero section's category icons**.

Initially, the Hero section categories were displayed in glass morphism cards with hover animations. The user then requested a cleaner icon-only look with no background boxes, using dark navy color, larger icons, and text labels underneath, similar to Mittanbud. This was successfully implemented, including responsiveness for desktop (4-col), tablet (3-col), and mobile (2-col).

Following this, the user requested an **underline hover effect** for these category icons, which was also successfully added. The underline appears smoothly in dark navy when hovering over an icon, matching Mittanbud's style.

Finally, specific icons for Bathroom, Cleaning, and Housing Associations underwent multiple rounds of refinement to ensure they were **visually clearer and exactly matched user-provided reference images**. The AI engineer iterated to produce:
- **Bathroom**: A clear shower head icon with holes and water drops.
- **Cleaning**: A distinct spray bottle icon with a trigger and sparkle effect.
- **Housing Associations**: A solid-filled house icon (not outlined or complex building).

These icons were implemented as monochrome SVGs, maintaining the consistent dark navy color, transparent background, and appropriate sizing and spacing, ensuring high recognition and professional aesthetics across all breakpoints. The hover effects (scale, color change, underline) continue to function perfectly with these updated icons.
