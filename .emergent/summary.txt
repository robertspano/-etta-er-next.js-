The AI engineer's trajectory focused on replicating 's UI/UX and functionality for the BuildConnect application, with a strong emphasis on localization to English and Icelandic. Initial efforts, summarized in the first chat message, involved foundational UI improvements, redesigning job posting flows, and revamping the All Categories overview. The core of the recent work, captured after the initial summary, involved two major feature implementations: a comprehensive company registration system and the expansion of category/subcategory listings across main service pages (Handcraft, House & Garden, Interior Renovation, Build New, Services). The company registration involved creating a new frontend component, adding backend API endpoints, and resolving several session expired errors due to incorrect API client usage and navigation logic. Subsequently, the focus shifted to populating main category pages with detailed subcategories and services, aligning them with the  structure. This involved extensive updates to existing frontend components, particularly , , , , and , ensuring bilingual support and pixel-perfect replication.

The BuildConnect application aims to be a construction services marketplace, mirroring the design and functionality of . It's built with a React frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB backend, supporting both Icelandic and English. The initial MVP included a redesigned homepage and a 3-step job posting wizard. Recent explicit user requests guided development:
1.  **UI/UX Replication**: Header, Hero section redesign; removal of Find Company section.
2.  **Job Posting Flow**: Cleaning flow changed to a 4-card subcategory selection; Post a Job button routed to an 8-card main category selection with search.
3.  **Category Overview**: All Categories page redesigned to a 2-column grid with nested 2-column subcategories.
4.  **Comprehensive Page Replication**: Add all missing pages from , maintaining layout, styling, navigation, category/subcategory lists, forms, and support pages (Company Search, various category landing pages, professional pages, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy).
5.  **Localization**: Convert all Norwegian text and sample data to English (primary) and Icelandic (secondary/toggle), ensuring consistent design.
6.  **Company Registration**: Implement a new company registration page with fields for Company ID, Electronic ID/Phone, Name, Email, and Password, matching a user-provided screenshot.
7.  **Category Expansion**: Ensure all main category pages (Handcraft, House & Garden, Interior Renovation, Build New, Services) have a comprehensive list of subcategories, accurately reflecting  and maintaining bilingual support.

<current_work>
The BuildConnect application has seen significant development to mimic . The AI engineer completed foundational UI/UX tasks and complex job posting flow transformations. Most recently, the work focused on two primary features:
1.  **Company Registration System**: A new  component was created to allow users to register their companies with specific details (Company ID, Electronic ID/Phone, Name, Email, Password). A dedicated public backend endpoint () was added in  to handle this. Initial attempts faced Session expired errors due to using an authenticated API client for registration and incorrect post-registration navigation. These issues were resolved by switching to  in , navigating to  instead of  after success, and implementing  in  and  to ensure clean state and proper success message display. The system now allows successful company registration, redirects to login with pre-filled email, and shows a success message.
2.  **Category Content Expansion**: The main category landing pages (, , , , ) were extensively updated. The user explicitly requested to add much more categories to match . This involved modifying the respective JSX files to include a significantly expanded list of subcategories/services, ensuring full bilingual support (Icelandic/English) for all new entries, correct pricing ranges, professional counts, and design elements. The  was expanded to 19 categories, and the other pages also received substantial additions, making the site more comprehensive and accurate to the reference.
