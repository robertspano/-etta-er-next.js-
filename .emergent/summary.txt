The AI engineer successfully progressed the BuildConnect application from an MVP to a feature-rich product. Initially, the focus was on robust authentication using FastAPI-Users (backend) and React's AuthContext (frontend), resolving critical dependency conflicts via the . After establishing authentication, the project shifted to implementing core marketplace features. This involved creating backend models and API routes for job requests, quotes, messaging, and notifications. Phase 1, focusing on the Customer Dashboard, was successfully completed, including pagination, job detail views, and messaging with file uploads. The work is now transitioning to Phase 2: Professional Dashboard implementation, leveraging existing skeleton components and integrating new functionality. The process involves continuous testing and user confirmations, ensuring alignment with product requirements.

The BuildConnect application is envisioned as a construction services marketplace similar to , supporting bilingualism (Icelandic/English) and featuring a professional design. The initial MVP included a React frontend with essential sections (Header, Hero with project submission, Services, How It Works, Stats, Testimonials, Footer) backed by FastAPI and MongoDB.

Recent enhancements specifically focused on:
1.  **User Authentication:** Implementing session-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies using  on the backend and a React  on the frontend. This includes Google OAuth, email verification, magic links, standard login/register/forgot password flows, protected routes, and role-based access (customer, professional, admin).
2.  **Professional Dashboard:** Developing a Mittanbud style dashboard for professionals, encompassing job requests/quotes (create, bid, accept/decline), in-app messaging (with file/photo uploads), calendar, service areas, invoicing/payouts (deferred), contractor profiles, ratings/reviews, and bilingual UI.
3.  **Core Marketplace Flow:** Establishing the central marketplace process: job request forms (category, title, description, postcode, photos, budget), professional listings, quote submission/management, accept/decline flows, in-app messaging per job, and notifications. Defined job statuses (open → quoted → accepted → in_progress → completed | cancelled) and admin tools. Payments were explicitly deferred.

<current_work>
The BuildConnect application is currently a functional MVP with a complete authentication system and foundational marketplace APIs. Phase 1, focusing on the Customer Dashboard, has been successfully implemented and tested.

Specifically, the Customer Dashboard () now features:
-   A My Requests list with status badges and pagination for managing job requests.
-   Navigation to a  page, which displays comprehensive job request details and all associated quotes (amount, message, expiry).
-   Actions within the Job Request Detail page to Accept, Decline, or Cancel quotes, with confirmation dialogues.
-   An integrated  component for in-app messaging threads related to specific jobs, supporting text and photo uploads.
-   Proper error/loading states and authentication-protected routes ensuring only authenticated users can access the dashboard and related pages.
-    and  have been updated to support new routes and i18n for these features.
Backend APIs for job requests, quotes, messages, and notifications have been developed and tested, showing a 96% success rate, ensuring the data layer for these frontend features is robust.

The work is now transitioning to **Phase 2: Professional Dashboard Implementation**. The AI engineer has started by creating new core components for professionals, specifically:
-   
-   
The next immediate step is to integrate these into the  and enable real data usage.
