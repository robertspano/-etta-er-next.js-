The AI engineer successfully evolved the BuildConnect application from MVP, focusing on homepage enhancements and a critical automotive job posting flow. Initially, the engineer tackled a persistent Failed to save progress error in the public job posting wizard, identifying and resolving a  misconfiguration. Concurrently, a major homepage redesign was executed, implementing a revamped How it works and a new Popular Projects section, aligning with user-provided screenshots. The Hero section remained untouched.

A significant new requirement was the Automotive category's special job posting flow, featuring a license plate input and backend vehicle lookup. This involved creating a dedicated frontend component (), updating translations, modifying the  for conditional rendering, and extending backend models and public API endpoints to support vehicle data and lookup. Debugging this phase involved fixing frontend rendering issues and ensuring correct API calls.

Finally, the engineer integrated a Find the right company for your project search section and a Latest Reviews section (with an empty state) onto the homepage, removing the Our Services section and adjusting the component order. The work consistently involved precise UI/UX matching, i18n support, and rigorous testing, demonstrating a methodical approach to feature development and bug resolution.

<product_requirements>
The BuildConnect application is a construction services marketplace, inspired by , supporting Icelandic and English. It features a React frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB backend with robust authentication, role-based dashboards, and a marketplace for job requests, bidding, and status tracking.

Current implementation includes:
- A comprehensive homepage redesigned to mirror , featuring distinct Hero, How It Works, Popular Projects, and newly added Find the right company for your project and Latest Reviews sections. The Our Services section was explicitly removed.
- A 3-step public job posting wizard, allowing unauthenticated users to submit job requests. This wizard supports draft saving via local storage and uses new public backend API endpoints.
- A specialized Automotive category flow within the job posting wizard. This flow, triggered when the Automotive tile is clicked, presents a unique Step 1 with a license plate input field (Icelandic format) and includes backend integration for vehicle lookups, prefilling details if found. Other categories continue to use the generic title/description Step 1.
- All new UI elements and functionalities are fully responsive and support both Icelandic and English languages via .

-   ****: Manages global contexts and routing. It was updated to reorder homepage sections to , , , , , and remove , , , .
-   ****: Centralizes UI text. Extended to include keys for automotive flow (headings, labels, help text), Find Company section, and Latest Reviews section (titles, empty state messages).
-   ****: Explains the app's process. Restyled to a centered 3-step layout with numbered badges and a Post Project CTA.
-   ****: A newly created component displaying category tiles in a responsive grid.
-   ****: **Newly created component**. Implements a full-width beige panel with headline, subtitle, two search inputs (category/keywords and location), and a Find company button, matching Mittanbud's design. It handles navigation to a professionals search page with filters.
-   ****: **Newly created component**. Implements the Latest Reviews section, matching Mittanbud's carousel UI, but initially displays an elegant empty state. It's prepared to accept review data.
-   ****: Manages the 3-step job posting flow. Modified to conditionally render  for the 'automotive' category slug and to handle its custom  logic for vehicle lookup. Updated summary step to display license plate data.
-   ****: **Newly created component**. Implements the specialized first step for the 'automotive' category, featuring a license plate input with validation, country badge, and a help link. Its  logic includes calling a backend vehicle lookup.
-   ****: Centralized API service.  was corrected to  to resolve frontend API call issues. Methods for draft job requests were updated to implicitly handle new automotive data.

<current_work>
The BuildConnect application has a complete authentication system and marketplace APIs. The AI engineer recently focused on a series of significant frontend and backend enhancements.

Firstly, the **3-step public job posting wizard** was refined. A critical Failed to save progress error, which previously persisted despite backend 200 OK responses, was thoroughly debugged. The root cause was identified as an incorrect  in , which was pointing to a preview URL instead of . This was rectified, and the wizard now functions correctly.

A major feature added was the **specialized Automotive job posting flow**. When a user selects the 'Automotive' category, the first step of the wizard () is replaced with a license plate input form, mirroring the Mittanbud layout. This involved:
-   Creating  with a centered card, IS flag badge, large license plate input (auto-uppercase, stripped spaces/dashes, 2-8 alphanumeric validation), and a Why do we need this? link.
-   Updating  with new automotive-specific texts.
-   Modifying  to conditionally render , handle its  logic, and update the final summary.
-   Extending  model (, , ).
-   Updating  to accept and store these new fields, and creating a new  endpoint (with a stubbed  service).
This entire flow, including frontend UI, validation, and backend data persistence/lookup, has been successfully implemented and verified.

Following this, the homepage underwent a **structural and design update**:
-   The Hero, How It Works, and Popular Projects sections were kept, with How It Works updated to a 3-step centered layout and Popular Projects displaying category tiles.
-   A new **Find the right company for your project section** () was added. This full-width beige panel features a headline, subtitle, and a search bar with category and location inputs, matching Mittanbud's design. It allows filtering professionals.
-   The existing Our Services section was completely removed.
-   A **Latest Reviews section** () was introduced immediately after Find the right company. This component was built to perfectly match Mittanbud's carousel UI but currently displays an elegant empty state, along with a  hook placeholder for future data integration.
All these homepage changes were verified for layout, responsiveness, and correct component ordering in .

<optional_next_step>
The next logical step is to implement the backend API for fetching actual reviews and integrate it into the  hook.
