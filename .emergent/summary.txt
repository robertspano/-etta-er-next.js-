The previous AI engineer successfully extended the BuildConnect application, primarily focusing on replicating 's UI/UX and integrating backend functionalities. Initial work involved completing a complex passwordless login system, including email template creation, API endpoint integration, and comprehensive frontend flow. Following this, significant effort was dedicated to UI/layout consistency, specifically resolving duplicate header issues across various pages and components (e.g., , , , , ). The Learn More sections were updated to be informational pages with specific, localized content and images, devoid of further navigation links. Icon styling was refined to ensure a thinner, consistent look across the application. Most recently, the engineer started implementing an automotive job posting flow, focusing on the UI for license plate input and subsequent details, with initial backend integration for license plate storage.

The BuildConnect application aims to be a construction services marketplace, mirroring  and  in UI/UX and functionality, with full English and Icelandic localization. Key features include company registration, a 3-step job posting wizard, and a multi-step authentication system (password-based, passwordless with email links, and 6-digit codes). Specific pages like Major Projects, Post Job category selection, How It Works Detailed, Company Requirements, and Reviews System were required. Backend APIs for registration, login, and job creation, with MongoDB storage, were essential. Extensive UI/UX refinements included consistent styling, icon alignment, header visibility, green success boxes, realistic mockups, and localized content for all new pages and sections. Recent requests focused on a comprehensive passwordless login flow, header glitch fixes, detailed content for Learn More pages, refined icon styling, and an automotive job posting process matching 's detailed input fields.

**Key Files and Changes:**
- : Debug logging for  was added and then reverted.
- : **(NEW)** Created to handle automotive-specific job creation, including license plate storage. It includes endpoints for creating and retrieving automotive jobs, linking to a MongoDB collection.
- : Updated to include the new , ensuring the API endpoints for automotive jobs are accessible.
- : Extensively modified to remove all internal links, implement user-provided bilingual Icelandic/English text for various sections, add an introductory paragraph above the hero image, and reintroduce the hero image with styling.
- : Entirely re-written to use user-provided bilingual Icelandic/English content, remove internal links, and display an introductory text and hero image.
- : Significantly updated to incorporate user-provided bilingual Icelandic/English content, remove internal links, and revert the hero image to the original star-rating mobile app interface instead of the city landscape.
- : Simplified to remove the search box and back button, adjusting spacing to be less cluttered.
- : The internal header div (containing back button and project title) was removed, and padding was added to align content with the global header.  import removed.
- : Updated to integrate with the new backend automotive API endpoint for license plate submission. The UI was adapted to show dynamic fields (car model, service categories, job description) and the license plate input to match 's visual style with an Icelandic flag, but this was later partially reverted to only show the license plate field in a specific format.
- : Icons were updated from custom filled SVGs or default Lucide to Lucide React components with  for a thinner appearance. The 'XL' and 'Bathroom' icons were also centered using flexbox utilities.
- : All custom filled SVG icons were replaced with Lucide React icons, using  for consistency. Necessary Lucide imports like  and  were added.
- : Icons in the category selector were updated to use Lucide React icons with  for a consistent, thinner look. Routing for category clicks was also adjusted to point to the correct specific job posting pages (e.g., , ).
- , , , , , , , : Duplicate header elements were removed from these components, relying solely on the global  in , and  padding was added where necessary.
- : The  function was implicitly configured to use the  and  detection.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on refining the automotive job posting page (). The user had requested that after entering a license plate, additional information fields should appear, mimicking the  design. The engineer implemented this, adding sections for car model, service categories, and job description, along with a Valid license plate confirmation. Backend integration for storing the license plate number was also completed in . However, the *very last* user request was to revert some of these additional fields and only display the license plate input with a visual Icelandic flag, making it look exactly like 's initial license plate entry, without the immediate display of subsequent details. The engineer's last action was to remove the logic for displaying extra content when the license plate is valid and remove an unnecessary  closure.
