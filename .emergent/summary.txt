The AI engineer successfully transitioned the BuildConnect application from a functional MVP to a more feature-rich product. The initial phase focused on integrating a robust authentication system using FastAPI-Users and Beanie on the backend, and a custom AuthContext with React on the frontend. This involved resolving significant dependency conflicts (/,  version changes) with the aid of the . After successful backend and frontend authentication implementation, the focus shifted to building the core marketplace features. This involved creating new backend models and API routes for job requests, quotes, messaging, and notifications, followed by comprehensive frontend updates for job request forms and dashboard functionalities. The development process was iterative, with continuous testing and user confirmations at each major phase.

The primary goal was to build BuildConnect, a construction services marketplace resembling , featuring a professional design, bilingual support (Icelandic/English), and core functionalities. The MVP included a React frontend with a Header, Hero section (project submission form), Services, How It Works, Stats, Testimonials, and Footer, all dynamically served from a FastAPI backend with MongoDB.

Recent requirements focused on expanding functionality:
1.  **User Authentication:** Session-based auth with HTTP-only cookies using  (backend) and React  (frontend). Include Google OAuth, email verification, magic links, login/register, forgot password, protected routes, and role-based access (customer/professional/admin).
2.  **Professional Dashboard:** Implement a Mittanbud style dashboard with job requests/quotes (create, bid, accept/decline), in-app messaging (with file/photo uploads), calendar, service areas, invoicing/payouts, contractor profiles (verification), ratings/reviews, and bilingual UI.
3.  **Core Marketplace Flow:** Implement job request forms (category, title, description, postcode, photos, budget), professional listings, quote submission/management, accept/decline flow, in-app messaging per job, and notifications. Define job statuses (open → quoted → accepted → in_progress → completed | cancelled) and admin tools. Payments are planned for a later stage.

-   ****: A new Beanie model defining the User schema for authentication. It was updated multiple times to resolve compatibility issues with  and .
-   ****: New file for FastAPI-Users authentication configuration, including user manager, authentication backends, and secret key setup. This file was crucial for integrating the authentication logic.
-   ****: New FastAPI router defining authentication endpoints like register, login, logout, verify, reset password. It integrates with  to expose auth APIs.
-   ****: Updated to initialize Beanie with the new  model, , , , and  models, ensuring they are connected to MongoDB. This is critical for database operations.
-   ****: Main backend entry point. Updated to include the new authentication routes and later, the marketplace routes (, , , ). This file orchestrates the FastAPI application.
-   ****: Modified to include  and  environment variables necessary for JWT and session management in the backend authentication.
-   ****: Crucial for dependency management. Updated to include , , , , , and . This file was frequently adjusted to resolve dependency conflicts.
-   **, , , **: New Beanie models defining the data structures for the core marketplace functionalities. These are foundational for the new features.
-   **, , , **: New FastAPI routers defining API endpoints for CRUD operations and business logic related to job requests, quotes, messaging, and notifications.
-   ****: Updated to include  for Axios, enabling the frontend to send and receive HTTP-only session cookies for authentication. Also updated to include new API endpoints for marketplace features.
-   ****: New React Context and Provider for managing global authentication state, user roles, login/logout functions, and token handling. Essential for centralizing auth logic.
-   ****: New React component wrapping routes, ensuring only authenticated and authorized users (based on role) can access specific pages.
-   ****: New components for login, registration, forgot password, reset password, and email verification forms. These provide the user interface for authentication.
-   ****: New skeleton components for Customer, Professional, and Admin dashboards, and , . These will house the user-specific marketplace views.
-   ****: Modified to dynamically display Sign In/Sign Up or a user dropdown with profile/dashboard/logout options based on authentication status.
-   ****: Main React app. Updated to wrap the application with  and configure React Router DOM for protected routes and role-based access.
-   ****: Updated to include all new English and Icelandic translations for authentication and marketplace-related UI texts, ensuring bilingual support for new features.
-   ****: New component for customers to create job requests. This is the entry point for the core marketplace flow.

<current_work>
The BuildConnect application is a fully functional full-stack MVP, now including a robust user authentication system and foundational marketplace APIs.

On the backend, a comprehensive authentication system using FastAPI-Users with Beanie ODM has been implemented. This includes:
-   A  model with various fields and roles (customer, professional, admin).
-   Authentication configuration () handling JWT and session cookies.
-   API routes for user registration, login, logout, password management, and email verification ().
-   New marketplace models (, , , ) and their corresponding API routes have been successfully implemented and tested, achieving a 100% success rate for CRUD operations and business logic.
-   Database service () is updated to manage all new models.
-   Environment variables (, ) are configured.
-   Dependency issues (e.g., /,  versions) were identified and resolved, often with the help of the , ensuring a stable backend environment.

On the frontend, built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/UI:
-   An  () manages user authentication state, allowing global access to login/logout, user data, and role information.
-   The  service is updated to handle session cookies ().
-    ensures only authenticated and authorized users can access specific routes.
-   Login, registration, forgot password, and reset password forms are implemented ().
-   Header navigation dynamically changes based on authentication status (Sign In/Up vs. User menu).
-   Skeleton components for Customer, Professional, and Admin dashboards are in place, ready to be populated with marketplace features.
-   All UI components () are verified to exist.
-   A quick smoke test of the registration and login flow passed successfully, confirming frontend-backend authentication integration.
-   The  component has been created, allowing users to submit new job requests, and the  is being updated to include marketplace functionalities.
