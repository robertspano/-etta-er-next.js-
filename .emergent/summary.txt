The previous AI engineer successfully migrated the BuildConnect application from React to Next.js (App Router), focusing on replicating  and  designs with full English and Icelandic localization. Key achievements include implementing robust language switching with persistence, redesigning the Hero and Popular Projects sections to feature dynamic, consistently sized category grids with Icelandic landscapes and proper styling, and creating several detailed content pages (Major Projects, Post Job, How It Works Detailed, Company Requirements, Reviews System). Critical UI/UX fixes included adjusting header visibility on various backgrounds and removing extraneous breadcrumb navigation from category pages. The development was frequently interrupted by a persistent Git/GitHub saving issue, which was escalated to support, but development continued on UI tasks. The last task completed was the removal of breadcrumb navigation from category pages, resulting in a clean header.

The BuildConnect application aims to be a construction services marketplace, replicating the UI/UX and functionality of  and , with comprehensive English and Icelandic localization. The initial MVP involved migrating from React to Next.js. User requests included:
1.  **UI/UX Replication:** Precise replication of 's Header, Hero section, and All Categories grid, later shifting to  for specific elements like transparent header and touching category boxes.
2.  **Core Features:** A 3-step job posting wizard, a new company registration page, and various specialized category pages (e.g., Automotive, Cleaning).
3.  **Localization:** All content must be fully localized to English and Icelandic, eliminating hardcoded Norwegian text. This included ensuring language switching in the header and persistence across sessions.
4.  **Specific Page Implementations:**
    *    matching 's detailed grid.
    *   A Major Projects (XL) page mirroring the old React app and .
    *   A Post Job category selection page following the Hero section's new design.
    *   Detailed information pages: How It Works Detailed, Company Requirements, and Reviews System, all replicating 's content and design.
5.  **Design Refinements:** Applying specific color palettes (, green accents), adjusting component sizes (e.g., category boxes in Hero/Popular Projects), ensuring icon alignment, and improving header visibility on diverse backgrounds.
6.  **Navigation Clean-up:** Removing unnecessary back buttons and breadcrumbs from category page headers.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed a series of UI/UX and routing improvements, focusing on replicating 's aesthetic. All breadcrumb navigation elements have been completely removed from category pages such as , , , and , ensuring a clean header area with only the BuildConnect logo and main navigation buttons. Furthermore, the header text colors were adjusted to dark gray, and the language selector was given a  background and  to ensure perfect visibility across all pages, regardless of their background. The application's homepage and various detailed information pages now flow seamlessly with consistent styling and improved usability.

All the UI/UX tasks requested by the user throughout the conversation, including language switching with persistence, Major Projects page, Hero section redesign (removing search, adjusting size, incorporating Icelandic landscape, and creating touching category boxes), Popular Projects section styling and icon alignment, a dedicated Post Job category selection page, fixing the How It Works button, removing the Latest Reviews section, and creating three detailed content pages (How It Works Detailed, Company Requirements, and Reviews System) have been implemented and verified as fully functional.

The primary outstanding issue is the persistent Git/GitHub saving error (Failed to push to git: 500: Git operation failed: Unable to create /app/.git/index.lock: File exists), which has blocked the ability to save the extensive work to GitHub. This issue was escalated to support, and its resolution is pending user action or intervention by the support team.
